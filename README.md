Personal Shield Mod for Space Engineers

## What this mod adds
This mod adds 6 ranks of personal shields.
Each next rank:

* increases capacity (charge),
* adds/expands protection by damage groups,
* requires rarer resources to craft.

The shield works like a gas bottle: the charge is stored in the item itself.
If you move the shield into a container, it keeps its charge.
To use the shield, keep it in your character’s inventory. If you have multiple shields, the best (highest rank) one will be used.
